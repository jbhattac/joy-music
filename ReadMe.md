#  Music Metadata Service

** Music Metadata Service**  is a scalable microservice designed 
to manage artist and track metadata, exposing RESTful APIs, 
integrated with PostgreSQL for persistence and Redis for caching. 
Itâ€™s Dockerized, cloud-ready, and supports monitoring through 
Prometheus and Spring Boot Actuator.

## Architecture Overview

* The application is dockerized, and also cloud ready.
* There is a Nginx sitting in front of the application as load balancer.
* There are two instances of application running(app1,app2).
* PostgreSQL is the primary database for storing music metadata.
* Application exposes Swagger UI for API exploration.
* Integrated Prometheus via Spring Boot Actuator for observability.
* Supports both Testing (H2) and production (PostgreSQL) profiles.

* Actuator Prometheus endpoint is exposed via the following url

``` 
  http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus
  
  (http_server_requests_seconds_count{uri="/api/v1/artists/**"})

* Also we have included a docker image of promethus configured with the actuator api.

``` 
  http://localhost:9090/
```

### Some Class and their purpose
  ```
- ArtistController - Controller class providing apis to get and set the artist meta data and their related tracks. Handles all the non error flows
- TrackRequestDto, TrackResponseDto - Used as dto to transfer data, also provides type safety and control.
- ArtistService, TrackService - Business logic layer(maintains SOLID principle), maintains the logic for Tracks and artist.
- ArtistSelectionStrategy- Strategy interface for selecting an Artist from a given list, based on a specific time-based criteria.
- ArtistStrategyFactory - Factory class for retrieving the appropriate ArtistSelectionStrategy 
                based on a given time period. This enables flexible and decoupled logic for selecting an artist
                by delegating the responsibility to different strategy implementations.
- DailyArtistSelectionStrategy - Strategy implementation for selecting the "Artist of the Day".
- ArtistRepository, TrackRepository - Only deals with data storage and retrival.(From SOLID - SRS)
- Artist, Track -Actual Entity object that holds the data.
- ErrorHandlingControllerAdvice - handles all the error flows.
- ErrorResponse - gives the business object for errors.
- ArtistControllerIntegrationTest - Integration test for testing end to end functionality.
- ArtistServiceTest, TrackServiceTest - Unit test for service layers in a granular way.
